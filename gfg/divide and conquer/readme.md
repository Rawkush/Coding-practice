1. Write a program to calculate pow(x,n)
Given two integers x and n, write a function to compute xn. We may assume that x and n are small and overflow doesnâ€™t happen.

2.Odd Game
Given an array of length N, starting from 1 to N. At each iteration, you remove all elements at odd positions, until only one element is left. Find the last remaining element.

3.Median of two sorted arrays of same size
There are 2 sorted arrays A and B of size n each. Write an algorithm to find the median of the array obtained after merging the above 2 arrays(i.e. array of length 2n). The complexity should be O(log(n)).

Note: Since the size of the set for which we are looking for the median is even (2n), we need to take the average of the middle two numbers and return the floor of the average.
